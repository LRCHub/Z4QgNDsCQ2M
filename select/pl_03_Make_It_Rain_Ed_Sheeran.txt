Black van loading up a shotgun
Head, chest, shoulder, shoulder,
keep the motor running
Stick to the plan
if the cops come
Mask down, gloves on,
can't prove nothing
Desperate times call
for desperate measures
Barrel pointed at the teller
Put the money in the bag,
and nobody gets hurt
Or it's bang, bang, bang,
and you're buried in the dirt
You can't feed a family
when the crops don't pay
If God won't do it,
then I'ma make it,
I'ma make it rain
30-day notice on the screen door
Hard work ain't working,
and the bad got worse
Sick of fucking praying
for a downpour
I'm tired of putting
nothing in the plate at church
Put the money in the bag,
and nobody gets hurt
Or it's bang, bang, bang,
and you're buried in the dirt
You can't feed a family
when the crops don't pay
If God won't do it,
then I'ma make it,
I'ma make it rain
It's kinda funny how we prayed,
prayed, prayed
And the rain showed up
as the van got away
Ain't by chance that
the cops came late
Guess it pays to have a sheriff
with the same last name
Put the money in the bag,
and nobody gets hurt
Or it's bang, bang, bang,
and you're buried in the dirt
You can't feed a family
when the crops don't pay
If God won't do it,
then I'ma make it,
I'ma make it rain
I'ma make it, I'ma make it rain
I'ma make it, I'ma make it rain
I'ma make it, I'ma make it rain
Oh, God,
please don't make me do it
Now we get to keep the farm,
we paid the bank cash
How are we the bad guys,
since we gave it all back?
