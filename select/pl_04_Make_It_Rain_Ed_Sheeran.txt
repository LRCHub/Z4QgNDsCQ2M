I can't make the moon glow
And I can't make a gray
storm cloud
And I can't make the wind
blow or the sun come out
I can't make the waves break
And I can't make the whole
sky blue
No, I can't do a lot of things,
but there's one thing
that I can do
I can make it rain
I can make her tears fall down
Take everything we used to be
And leave it puddled up on
the ground
Yeah, I can make it flood
And watch it wash it all away
Take all our love and pour
it down the drain
Yeah, I can make it rain
I can make it rain
No, I can't make her stay
And I can't make her take
me back
I can't make her miss me, no,
I can't do none of that
I can't make her smile
And I can't make her hurt
no less
And, no,
I can't unbreak her heart,
but I can leave it soakin' wet
'Cause I can make it rain
And I can make her tears
fall down
Take everything that we used
to be
And leave it puddled up on
the ground
'Cause I can make it flood
And watch it wash it all away
Take all our love and pour
it down the drain
Yeah, I can make it rain
I can make it rain
And I can see her pain in
every drop
But I can't see no way to
make it stop
But I can make it rain
And I can make her tears
fall down
Take everything that we used
to be
And leave it puddled up on
the ground
Yeah, 'cause I can make it flood
And watch it wash it all away
And take all our love and
pour it down the drain
Yeah,
I can take all our love
and just pour it down the drain
'Cause I can make it rain
Yeah, I can make it rain
